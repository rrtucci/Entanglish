The github website currently doesn't render jupyter 
notebooks 100% correctly. For instance, it doesn't recognize
Latex macros in the markdown cells. Luckily, the jupyter project
offers a service for rendering notebooks found at other websites.
The link below will show all our notebooks rendered properly.
